The best place to call this is in the 'player_spawn' event when 'params.team' equals 0 (unassigned). The event is always fired once for team unassigned when the player entity spawns. Similarly, for engineer buildings, this function can also be called once. The 'player_builtobject' is fired when an engineer building is created (or re-placed after moving, but this shouldn't matter)."]
